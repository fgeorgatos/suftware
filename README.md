These can be tested out by using the ipython notebooks ipynb/deft\_demo.ipynb

## Internal Notes:
- This branch will be used to refactor the structure of deft_1d by adding testing
- Any developmental or refactoring changes should be first merged here before merged with master: make your own branch to keep track of your changes. (i.e. don't make changes directly in this branch.)
