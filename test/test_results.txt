#0
Test that DEFT works on a simple data set
G=100, alpha=3, bbox=[-6, 6], N=100, data_type=wide, should_succeed=True
Succeeded!
Outcome: good.

#1
Test that bbox of size > 2 fails
G=100, alpha=3, bbox=[-6, 6, 1], N=100, data_type=wide, should_succeed=False
Failed in controlled way.
Outcome: good.

#2
Test if bbox with misordered boundaries fails
G=100, alpha=3, bbox=[6, -6], N=100, data_type=wide, should_succeed=False
Failed in controlled way.
Outcome: good.

#3
Test that negative alpha leads to failure
G=100, alpha=-3, bbox=[-6, 6], N=100, data_type=wide, should_succeed=False
Failed in controlled way.
Outcome: good.

#4
Test that negative G leads to failure
G=-100, alpha=3, bbox=[-6, 6], N=100, data_type=wide, should_succeed=False
Problem! Test failed in an uncontrolled way!
Outcome: BAD!

#5
Test if G=0 fails
G=0, alpha=3, bbox=[-6, 6], N=100, data_type=wide, should_succeed=False
Problem! Test failed in an uncontrolled way!
Outcome: BAD!

#6
Test if non-integner G fails
G=100, alpha=3, bbox=[-6, 6], N=100, data_type=wide, should_succeed=False
Problem! Test failed in an uncontrolled way!
Outcome: BAD!
